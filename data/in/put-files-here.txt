To run the code, you need the following files:

- data/in/people.txt
  A text file generated by querying Wikidata (or by any other means you find convenient).
  Each line is the title of a Wikipedia article about a person.

  This is the SPARQL query I used:

  PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
  PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>
  PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>
  PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
  SELECT ?page_title (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?occupationLabel; separator="|") AS ?occupations)
  WHERE {
    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .
    OPTIONAL {
      ?item wdt:P106 ?occupation .
      ?occupation rdfs:label ?occupationLabel .
      FILTER (lang(?occupationLabel) = "en")
    }
    ?article schema:about ?item;
             schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>;
             schema:name ?page_title .
  }
  GROUP BY ?page_title

- data/in/links-filt.txt
  A text file generated from a Wikipedia dump using wikicrush (https://www.github.com/trishume/wikicrush).
  Each line is a list of strings, separated by |, where the first string is the title of an article
  and the rest are titles of the other articles it links to.

- data/in/redirects.txt
  A text file generated from a Wikipedia dump using wikicrush (https://www.github.com/trishume/wikicrush).
  Each line is two strings, separated by |, where the first string is the title of an article
  and the second is the title of the article it redirects to.
